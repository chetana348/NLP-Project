Perform the calculation: Add two six-digit numbers by breaking the task into smaller parts. Decompose this addition into smaller parts, adding each corresponding set of digits separately. Show each step of your calculation clearly, and provide the final sum as a single, definitive answer. Ensure that each step is accurately calculated and presented in a clear, orderly manner. An example of this task is shown here:

BEGIN EXAMPLE
Input:
Number 1: 593682, Number 2: 417295

Response:
To calculate the sum of 593682 and 417295, we will decompose the addition into smaller parts, adding each corresponding set of digits separately. The process is as follows:

Units place: 2 (from 593682) + 5 (from 417295) = 7
Tens place: 8 (from 593682) + 9 (from 417295) = 17 (carry 1 to the next place, 7 is the subtotal for tens)
Hundreds place: 6 (from 593682) + 2 (from 417295) + 1 (carried over) = 9
Thousands place: 3 (from 593682) + 7 (from 417295) = 10 (carry 1 to the next place, 0 is the subtotal for thousands)
Ten-thousands place: 9 (from 593682) + 1 (from 417295) + 1 (carried over) = 11 (carry 1 to the next place, 1 is the subtotal for ten-thousands)
Hundred-thousands place: 5 (from 593682) + 4 (from 417295) + 1 (carried over) = 10 (1 is the subtotal for hundred-thousands)
Now, we add the subtotals together:
1 (hundred-thousands) + 1 (ten-thousands) + 0 (thousands) + 9 (hundreds) + 7 (tens) + 7 (units)

This gives us the final sum: 1010977

Therefore, the sum of 593682 and 417295 is 1010977.
