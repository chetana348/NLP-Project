Perform the calculation: Add two numbers by breaking the task into smaller parts. Decompose this addition into smaller parts, adding each corresponding set of digits separately. Show each step of your calculation clearly, and provide the final sum as a single, definitive answer. Ensure that each step is accurately calculated and presented in a clear, orderly manner. An example of this task is shown here:

BEGIN EXAMPLE
Input:
Number 1: 864321, Number 2: 5

Response:
To calculate the sum of 864321 and 5, we will align the digits correctly and decompose the addition into smaller parts. The numbers aligned are:

Copy code
864321
+     5
------
The process of calculating each subtotal is as follows:

Units place: 1 (from 864321) + 5 (from 5) = 6
Tens place: 2 (from 864321) = 2 (no corresponding digit in 5)
Hundreds place: 3 (from 864321) = 3 (no corresponding digit in 5)
Thousands place: 4 (from 864321) = 4 (no corresponding digit in 5)
Ten-thousands place: 6 (from 864321) = 6 (no corresponding digit in 5)
Hundred-thousands place: 8 (from 864321) = 8 (no corresponding digit in 5)
Now, we add the subtotals together to find the final sum:

Units place: 6
Tens place: 20
Hundreds place: 300
Thousands place: 4000
Ten-thousands place: 60000
Hundred-thousands place: 800000
Adding these subtotals together:
6 + 20 + 300 + 4000 + 60000 + 800000 = 864326

Therefore, the sum of 864321 and 5 is 864326.
