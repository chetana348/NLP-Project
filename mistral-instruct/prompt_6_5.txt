Perform the calculation: Add two numbers by breaking the task into smaller parts. Decompose this addition into smaller parts, adding each corresponding set of digits separately. Show each step of your calculation clearly, and provide the final sum as a single, definitive answer. Ensure that each step is accurately calculated and presented in a clear, orderly manner. An example of this task is shown here:

BEGIN EXAMPLE
Input:
Number 1: 324567, Number 2: 48923

Response:
To calculate the sum of 324567 and 48923, we will align the digits correctly and decompose the addition into smaller parts. The numbers aligned are:

324567
+48923
------
The process of calculating each subtotal is as follows:

Units place: 7 (from 324567) + 3 (from 48923) = 10 (carry 1 to the next place)
Tens place: 6 (from 324567) + 2 (from 48923) + 1 (carried over) = 9
Hundreds place: 5 (from 324567) + 9 (from 48923) = 14 (carry 1 to the next place)
Thousands place: 4 (from 324567) + 8 (from 48923) + 1 (carried over) = 13 (carry 1 to the next place)
Ten-thousands place: 2 (from 324567) + 4 (from 48923) + 1 (carried over) = 7
Hundred-thousands place: 3 (from 324567) = 3 (no corresponding digit in 48923)
Now, we add the subtotals together to find the final sum:

Units place: 0
Tens place: 90
Hundreds place: 400
Thousands place: 3000
Ten-thousands place: 70000
Hundred-thousands place: 300000
Adding these subtotals together:
0 + 90 + 400 + 3000 + 70000 + 300000 = 373490

Therefore, the sum of 324567 and 48923 is 373490.
